# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description
This repository contains my implementation for the Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz. The challenge required building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

The quiz has the following functionality:

- Start button: When clicked, the timer starts, and the first question appears.
- Questions: Each question has buttons for each answer. When an answer is clicked, the next question appears.
- Timer: The timer subtracts time from the clock if the answer clicked was incorrect. The quiz ends when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
- End screen: When the game ends, the userâ€™s score is displayed, and they have the ability to save their initials and score.

The repository contains the JavaScript code `logic.js`, `questions.js`, `scores.js` and the HTML files `index.html` and `highscores.html`. The CSS styles are in the `styles.css` file.
